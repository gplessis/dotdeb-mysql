First show replication 1->2->3

use test;
create table t1(a int primary key, b varchar(50)) engine=ndb;

Break Cluster3's link with Cluster2

Make further changes on Cluster1
[connection cluster1]
insert into test.t1 values (2, "The cotton is high");
insert into test.t1 values (3, "Daddys rich");
Show changes exist on Cluster2
select * from test.t1 order by a;

2	The cotton is high
3	Daddys rich
Check data on Cluster3
[connection cluster3]
select * from test.t1 order by a;
a	b

Now change Cluster3 to skip-over Cluster2 and get binlog direct from Cluster1
select * from mysql.ndb_apply_status order by server_id;

Now show that cluster 3 is successfully replicating from Cluster1

Clean up
