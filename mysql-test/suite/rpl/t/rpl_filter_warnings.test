# Bug#17986385:LOG-WARNINGS=2 UNUSABLE ON SLAVE WITH FILTERS
#
# Problem:
# ========
# If a slave is configured with replication filters and log-warnings=2, every
# statement which is filtered writes an entry to the error log:
#
# [Warning] Slave SQL: Could not execute Query event. Detailed error: Slave
# SQL thread ignored the query because of replicate-*-table rules
# For busy servers which generate a lot of statements that get filtered, the
# result is an error log which can quickly grow into the GB range.
#
# Test:
# =====
# Set replicate-do-table=test.t1. Execute  statements on ignored tables.
# During the execution of the first such statement the actual warning will be
# printed and the remaining such errors will be suppressed. Script sleeps for
# a minute and executes another statment on the ignored table so that
# "error throttle" becomes active and checks if 1 minute has elapsed and
# prints the acutal error message and along with that it also prints the number
# of errors that were suppressed. With fix less warnings should be printed.
# With bug we get 5 warnings.
