    Bug#27194270: LIMIT PASSWORD HASH ROUNDS IN SHA256-CRYPT ALGORITHM
    
    Description: Authentication string for sha256_password
                 can contain an optional part specifying
                 number of hash rounds to be performed.
                 Though default is 5000, an
                 authentication_string directly inserted
                 in mysql.user table can contain different
                 value. This may cause extra computations
                 and may introduce unnecessary delay.
    
    Solution: Fixed the maximum number of rounds allowed.

    Bug#27099029: UNLIMITED LENGTH OF THE PASSWORD
    
    Description: my_crypt_genhash depends on the length of
                 plaintext password. Longer the password,
                 more is the time required to produce the
                 transformation. An unusually large password
                 may consume considerable amount of time.
    
    Fix: Fixed length of plaintext password to 256 bytes for
         SHA256_PASSWORD authentication plugin. Restricted
         PASSWORD() to accept at max 256 bytes if old_passwords
         is set to 2.

    Bug#25586773 - INCORRECT BEHAVIOR FOR CREATE TABLE SELECT IN A LOOP IN SP
    
    For the SQL statements in the stored routine, while resolving the
    statement (on first execution or on re-parse trigger) memory is
    allocated on the permanent mem-root. After executing the statement
    for the first time a state of the statement query arena
    is changed to STMT_EXECUTED. Subsequent execution uses execution
    mem-root which is freed at the end of the execution.
    
    But for CREATE TABLE ... SELECT(CTS), state of the statement query
    arena is never changed to the STMT_EXECUTED. Allocation in the
    subsequent execution goes to the permanent mem-root. Hence the
    memory growth or leak is observed.
    
    Why query arena state is not switched for CTS?
    ==============================================
    For the CTS, existence of the table being created is checked
    while executing the statement. If table already exists then error
    (or warning with IF TABLE EXISTS clause) is reported.
    In the subsequent execution allocation(when table does not exists)
    for items being created goes to permanent mem-root(as statement
    query arena state is set STMT_INITIALIZED_FOR_SP always). So the
    next execution will have valid pointers to refer.
    
    If state of query arena is set to the STMT_EXECUTED after first
    execution then state is changed even when table exists error or
    warning is reported. In this case subsequent execution uses
    execution mem-root to allocate items. This memory is freed at
    the end of the execution. So the next execution of routine refers
    to invalid pointers.
    
    To avoid any issues related to invalid pointer reference(e.g.
    bug19897405) the state of the statement query arena is set to
    STMT_INITIALIZED_FOR_SP always for CTS by patch for bug25053286.
    
    Fix:
    ==============================================
    For the CTS in the stored routine, special handling is required
    for the case of table exists error or warning.
    
    In case of table exists error or warning, the statement arena
    is set to STMT_INITIALIZED_FOR_SP. With this change, next
    execution uses permanent mem-root while resolving the statement
    (this change fixes invalid pointer reference issues
     e.g. bug19897405).
    If the execution is successful then statement query arena is
    changed to the STMT_EXECUTED. So on the subsequent execution of
    the CTS, memory is allocated in the execution mem-root (this
    change fixes memory growth or leak issue).
    
    Additional changes for  mysql-8.0 and mysql-trunk:
    --------------------------------------------------
    As part of this patch, code is modified to check the SP statement
    execution state instead of error codes or flags while setting
    the statement query arena state.
    
    Modification is made so that, SP statement query arena state
    is not changed when error occurs in the statement parsing,
    table opening and preparation phase. Query arena state is
    changed to STMT_EXECUTED when error occurs in the execution
    phase (or when execution succeeds). If "table exists" error
    during execution phase of CTS then the state of the
    statement query arena is set to STMT_INITIALIZED_FOR_SP,
    as if statement must be reprepared.

    Bug #24296076   INNODB REPORTS WARNING WHILE INNODB_UNDO_LOG_TRUNCATE IS ENABLED
    
    PROBLEM
    -------
    
    This warning message is printed when trx_sys->rseg_history_len is greater than some
    arbitrary magic number (2000000). By seeing the reproducing scenario where we keep
    a read view open and do a lot of transactions on table which increases the hitsory
    length it is entirely possible that trx_sys->rseg_history_len can exceed 2000000.
    So this is not a bug due to corruption of history length.The warning message was
    just added to test some scenario and not removed.
    
    FIX
    ---
    
    1.Print this warning message only for debug versions.
    2.Modified the warning message with more detailed information.
    3.Don't crash even in debug versions.

    Bug #26881946: INCORRECT BEHAVIOR WITH "VALUES"
    
    Issue:
    ------
    VALUES doesn't have a type() function and is considered a
    Item_field.
    
    Solution for 5.7:
    -----------------
    Add a new type() function for Item_values_insert.
    
    On 8.0 and trunk it was fixed by Mithun's Bug#19601973.
    
    Solution for 5.6:
    -----------------
    Additionally Bug#17458914 is backported.
    
    This will address the problem of using VALUES() in
    INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE. Create a field object
    only if it is in the UPDATE clause, else return a NULL
    item.
    
    This will also address the problems mentioned in
    Bug#14789787 and Bug#16756402.
    
    Solution for 5.5:
    -----------------
    As mentioned above Bug#17458914 is backported.
    
    Additionally Bug#14786324 is also backported.
    
    When VALUES() is detected outside its meaningful place,
    it should be treated as NULL and is thus replaced with a
    Field_null object, with the same name as the original
    field.
    
    Fields with type NULL are generally not handled well inside
    the server (e.g Innodb will not accept them and it is
    impossible to create them in regular tables). So create a
    new const NULL item instead.

    Bug #26492721   MYSQL/INNODB CRASHES DURING ALTER TABLE
    
    PROBLEM
    
    While doing an alter table that does multiple change columns , the heap
    assigned for the particular table increases and corresponding increase
    to dict_sys->size isn't done because of which the dict_sys->size keeps
    decreasing with every iteration of set of alter tables provided in the
    bug page hitting the assertion dict_sys->size > 0 .
    
    FIX
    
    Fix is to add a check for any table heap size increase during change
    column and add the increased value of heap size to dict_sys->size to
    avoid it getting diminished on subsequent runs of alter tables.

    Bug #26880757: MYISAM_USE_MMAP=1 ON WINDOWS FREQUENTLY DOES
                   NOT UPDATE FILE ON DISK
    
    Description:- When the server variable, "myisam_use_mmap" is
    enabled, MyISAM tables on windows are not updating the file
    on disk even when the server variable "flush" is set to 1.
    This is inturn making the table corrupted when encountering
    a power failure.
    
    Analysis:- When the server variable "myisam_use_mmap" is set,
    files of MyISAM tables will be memory mapped using the OS
    APIs mmap()/munmap()/msync() on Unix and CreateFileMapping()
    /UnmapViewOfFile()/FlushViewOfFile() on Windows. msync() and
    FlushViewOfFile() is responsible for flushing the changes
    made to the in-core copy of a file that was mapped into
    memory using mmap()/CreateFileMapping() back to the
    file system.  FLUSH is determined by the OS unless
    explicitly called using msync()/FlushViewOfFile().
    
    When the server variables "myisam_use_mmap" and "flush" are
    enabled, MyISAM is only flushing the files from file system
    cache to disc using "mysql_file_sync()" and not the memory
    mapped file from memory to FS cache using "my_msync()".
    ["my_msync()" inturn calls  msync() on Unix and
    FlushViewOfFile() on Windows.
    
    Fix:- As part of the fix, if server variable
    "myisam_use_mmap" is enabled along with  "flush",
    "my_msync()" is invoked to flush the data in memory to file
    system cache and followed by "mysql_file_sync()" which will
    flush the data from file system cache to disk.

    Bug#26748533 SEMISYNC MASTER CRASH AFTER RESET MASTER
    
    Problem: While some active transaction are waiting for ack from Slave,
             executing 'RESET MASTER' is leaving Master's semisync
             in bad state.
    
    Analysis: In ReplSemiSyncMaster::commitTrx, when transaction is
              waiting for an acknowledgement from the Slave, before
              it goes into the wait state, it increases
              rpl_semi_sync_master_wait_sessions status variable to indicate
              the number of sessions waiting for the acknowledgements. Also
              before it goes into the wait state, it releases LOCK_binlog_ lock
              to avoid any hang issues for the other sessions which are looking
              for LOCK_binlog_. When the thread releases LOCK_binlog_ lock and
              waiting for the acknowledgement, there is a possibility that
              some other thread which is executing 'RESET MASTER' can get the lock
              and reset all the status variables. rpl_semi_sync_master_wait_sessions
              is one of such status variables. After the wait is over in
              ReplSemiSyncMaster::commitTrx (either the timeout or received acknowledgement
              from Slave), the logic is decreasing rpl_semi_sync_master_wait_sessions)
              without checking whether 'RESET MASTER' was executing by any other parallel
              thread. This leads invalid value for rpl_semi_sync_master_wait_sessions
              status variable. Any other logic which is trying to use this status variable
              will lead to unexpected results in the server.
    Fix: Check the value of rpl_semi_sync_master_wait_sessions before decrementing
         it and decrement it only if it is non-zero value.

    Bug #26867652: INCORRECT BEHAVIOR WITH PREPARE STATEMENT
                   AND PARAM IN ORDER BY
    
    Issue:
    ------
    This issue can occur when the ORDER BY list refers to a
    column that contains a parameter in the select list.
    
    Solution:
    ---------
    In JOIN::update_depend_map and get_sort_by_table, the
    ORDER BY list's used_tables isn't checked for parameters.
    This can result in incorrect behavior.
    
    This is a partial backport of Roy's

    Invalid input parameters could lead to wrong result buffer.
    Which can cause an assert due to traversing to uninitialized
    pointers and abrupt exit or cyclic processing of the result
    buffer.
    
    Fix included handling of below scenarios.
    1. Uninitialized structure elements.
    2. Handling of NULL pointers.
    3. Breakout from cyclic loops.
    4. Wrong result object (Point with more than one coordinates).

    Bug#26877788 SELECT FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES RETURNS NO RECORDS WHEN ORDER BY IS USED
    
    During subquery materialization table list is modified
    so that empty JOIN_TAB table is inserted in the middle of
    table list. It leads to interruption of the loop in
    get_schema_tables_result() function and tables which are
    after empty JOIN_TAB are not processed.
    
    The fix:
    Do not interrupt the loop on empty JOIN_TAB.

    BUG#21625016: INNODB FULL TEXT CASE SENSITIVE NOT WORKING.
    
    Analysis:
    ========
    
    Full text search on InnoDB tables using binary collation
    for indexed columns does not return case sensitive matches.
    
    For case sensitive matches, it is recommended to use binary
    collation for the indexed columns. During the processing
    of the FTS query, the query string is always converted to
    lower case regardless of the collation type. Hence, case
    insensitive matches were returned during the FTS search.
    
    Fix:
    ===
    Don't convert the query string to lower case during FTS
    search if the collation of the indexed column is of
    binary type.

    separate locations for each package, since apt does not allow multiple
    packages to share the same file. We've used the rules file to make
    copies of the files for each package, but it's cleaner to do it in
    the install file for each package

    Bug#26372491 - RCE THROUGH THE MISHANDLE OF BACKSLASH
    
    DESCRIPTION:
    ===========
    The bug is related to incorrect parsing of SQL queries
    when typed in on the CLI. The incorrect parsing can
    result in unexpected results.
    
    ANALYSIS:
    ========
    The scenarios mainly happens for identifier names
    with a typical combination of backslashes and backticks.
    The incorrect parsing can either result in executing
    additional queries or can result in query truncation.
    This can impact mysqldump as well.
    
    FIX:
    ===
    The fix makes sure that such identifier names are
    correctly parsed and a proper query is sent to the
    server for execution.

    Bug #25989915: LOOSE INDEX SCANS RETURNING WRONG RESULT
    
    Problem:
    --------
    This problem occurs under the following conditions:
    1) Table has a unique index.
    2) Query checks whether a loose index scan is applicable to
    this query. And mistakenly chooses it despite unique
    indexes having no index extensions.
    
    This is can give wrong results. A similar problem also
    exists in Bug #26532061.
    
    Solution:
    ---------
    Index extensions are not applicable to UNIQUE indexes for
    loose index scans.
    
    So Field::is_part_of_actual_key should also consider the
    HA_NOSAME flag.

    Solution:
    ---------
    set_charset on the string value should be called after
    val_str has been calculated. This is already done in
    val_str_ascii functions for MD5 and SHA functions.
